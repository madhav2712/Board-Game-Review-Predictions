# Board-Game-Review-Predictions
Linear  Regressor Model  VS RandomForest Regressor

Business Context:
Reviews can make or break a product; as a result, many companies take drastic measures to ensure that their product receives
good reviews. When it comes to board games, reviews and word-of-mouth are everything. In this project, I  have used  linear 
regression model to predict the average review a board game will receive based on characteristics such as minimum and maximum 
number of players, playing time, complexity, etc.


Steps followed to gain Insights about this datset and also to attain RMSE of (Linear Regressor and Random Forest Regressor):-

Implemented correlation matrix, heat map on imported dataset to analyze relationships between parameters;triggered insights on  type of machine learning algorithm to utilize

Dropped(null, zero rating board  games) parameters constituting 25% of actual dataset for data cleaning
Deployed  linear regressor model, ensemble model  to predict average review of each board game
Compared results to track performance of linear(LR) and non-linear models(Random Forest Regression)
